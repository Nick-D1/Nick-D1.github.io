This webiste was created for my CS465 Full Stack Development course, it has since been updated to accommodate a more modern and secure coding style. For the frontend of this application, I used Express with Handlebars which functioned as the client-side website, leveraged server-side rending for dynamic generation. Additionally, Angular was the admin interface built as an SPA. The SPA offered a dynamic user experience on the client side which aided in managing the CRUD operations. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for its schema flexibility and ability to scale accordingly. MongoDB aligned with 
the frontend data handling requirements and enabled an easy integration with necessary queries. To improve the functionality of this application I focused on three main topics, Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Database improvement. 
I added a feedback form for users to submit their thoughts on the website. Next, I harden the code against attacks by improving the login function, removing duplicates, and added client-side validation along with loading flags to block repeat subs. Lastly, I updated the readability, adding cleaner code, and error handling, making it easier for others to follow my logic.
